        "1_para": "The Deepthought Initiative (DTI) collaboration applies computational techniques and tools to analyze the vast literature in scientific research, with a specific focus on leveraging machine learning to understand astrophysics literature. Vicente Amado Olivo's research revolves around tracking astrophysics publications and identifying astronomers worldwide through publications on arXiv. Being part of a research group comprising astrophysicists, Vicente's work in computational meta-research ensures that the tools developed by DTI are directly applicable to the needs of astrophysicists. To further their research in astrophysics meta-research, Vicente is visiting ESAC, a world-leading space agency, in order to gain firsthand experience with their current research systems, understand their future needs, actively participate in a proposal cycle, and collaborate with the librarians at ESA."
