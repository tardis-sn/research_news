  "short_description": "Software plays a hidden but crucial role in astronomy research. This project aims to recognize the scientists behind these tools. It will analyze open source astronomy software on ASCL.net, considering both the impact (citations) and time invested (code commits) to identify key contributors who connect data with astronomical understanding.",

    "1_para": "This project aims to highlight the under-appreciated role of software development in astronomy. Open source software fosters reproducible research by making data analysis tools and methodologies transparent and accessible. The project proposes to identify key scientists who bridge the gap between observational data and physical understanding of astronomical phenomena. It will focus on analyzing projects hosted on ASCL.net, a platform specifically dedicated to astronomy software.",
    "2_para": "The analysis will consider ASCL.net projects that are linked to scientific publications and have a publicly accessible code repository. Projects hosted on non-git platforms will be excluded. To assess a scientist's contribution, the project will consider two factors:  impact, measured by the number of citations a project's linked paper receives; and time invested, estimated by the number of days with code commits. This approach is considered more effective than simply counting commits or code changes."
