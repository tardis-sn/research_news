As the global research community grows, finding qualified reviewers has become increasingly difficult. DTI Reviewer addresses this challenge using deterministic machine learning techniques to identify experts based on a dataset created by cross-matching NASA/ADS publications with ORCID profiles. Our initial approach uses TF-IDF to rank expertise.",
        "2_para": "<i><u>Example: Finding Experts with Research Vectors</u></i>  : For each researcher, we build a knowledge vector by combining the titles and abstracts of their publications. These are embedded into a numerical vector space. When a user submits a query (e.g., the abstract of a new manuscript), we embed that query in the same space. We then compute cosine similarity between the query and each researcherâ€™s vector to rank potential reviewers by how closely their past work aligns with the query. Submit your query via the web interface to get a ranked list of experts. Submit any length of text from a few words to a full-text paper."
