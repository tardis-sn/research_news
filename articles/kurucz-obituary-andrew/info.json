Much of the work we do has been based on his many years of careful work gathering and processing atomic data for astrophysics research. Our default atomic data file bears his name and will continue to do so. We recommend reading his Boston Globe obituary at https://obits.mlive.com/us/obituaries/bostonglobe/name/robert-kurucz-obituary?id=57719179 and consider donating to UNICEF to honor his legacy."
